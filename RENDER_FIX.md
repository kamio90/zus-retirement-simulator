# Render Deployment Fix - Manual Configuration Required

## Issue
The Render service `zus-retirement-simulator-ui` is still using npm for dependency installation, even though we've updated render.yaml to use pnpm. This is because the service was created manually and is not using the render.yaml blueprint configuration.

## Root Cause
The existing Render service was created through the Render Dashboard (not via Blueprint), so changes to render.yaml are not automatically applied to it.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Existing Service (Recommended)
Manually update the build settings in Render Dashboard:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select the `zus-retirement-simulator-ui` service
3. Go to "Settings"
4. Update the following settings:
   - **Build Command**: 
     ```bash
     corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm -F web build
     ```
   - **Environment Variables**: Add if not present:
     - `NODE_VERSION` = `20.12.2`
     - `PNPM_VERSION` = `9.12.0`
5. Save changes and trigger a manual deploy

### Option 2: Recreate from Blueprint
Delete the existing service and create it from render.yaml:

1. Delete the `zus-retirement-simulator-ui` service from Render Dashboard
2. Go to "Blueprints" â†’ "New Blueprint Instance"  
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select this repository and branch
5. Render will create the service with name `zus-retirement-simulator-ui` using the render.yaml configuration

### Option 3: Use the Build Script
The repository now includes `render-build.sh` which you can use as the build command:

```bash
./render-build.sh
```

This script:
- Enables corepack
- Prepares pnpm 9.12.0
- Installs dependencies with pnpm
- Builds the web application

## Files Changed
- `render.yaml` - Updated service name to match existing service
- `render-build.sh` - New build script for easier configuration

## Next Steps
Choose one of the options above to fix the deployment. Option 1 is recommended for quickest resolution.
