# Coverage & Risks

- Traceability matrix: every actuarial rule from SPEC_ENGINE.md mapped to test case
- Residual risks: future numeric calibration when official tables available
- Non-functional: purity, determinism, performance, explainability
- Acceptance: all pipeline steps covered, boundary/negative cases present
